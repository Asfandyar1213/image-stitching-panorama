# Image Stitching Project Analysis Report

## 1. Technical Overview

### 1.1 Core Technologies Used
- **OpenCV (4.8.0)**: Primary image processing library
- **NumPy (1.24.3)**: Numerical computations and array operations
- **Gradio (3.50.2)**: Web interface for user interaction

### 1.2 Key Algorithms Implemented
1. **Feature Detection (SIFT)**
   - Scale-Invariant Feature Transform
   - Detects distinctive keypoints in images
   - Provides scale and rotation invariance
   - Generates descriptors for each keypoint

2. **Feature Matching (FLANN)**
   - Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors
   - Efficient matching of feature descriptors
   - Ratio test (0.7) for quality control
   - Reduces false matches

3. **Homography Estimation**
   - RANSAC-based homography computation
   - Minimum 4 point correspondences required
   - Handles perspective transformation
   - Robust to outliers

4. **Image Blending**
   - Weighted averaging in overlapping regions
   - Mask-based blending
   - Seamless transition between images

## 2. Implementation Analysis

### 2.1 Code Structure
```python
# Main Components:
1. detect_and_compute() - Feature detection
2. match_features() - Feature matching
3. find_homography() - Homography computation
4. stitch_images() - Main stitching pipeline
5. process_images() - Interface handler
```

### 2.2 Performance Considerations
- **Memory Usage**: O(n²) for feature matching
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Feature detection: O(n log n)
